            <h2> Context</h2>
            <p> The prompt for this project was to make a adventure about a topic that students picked during class. The topic that I decided on was a Job Interview.</p>
            <h2> Content</h2>
            <p> Me and Gabriel managed to make a HTML project detailing the life of someone who is about to go to a interview.
                Although we made it a "little" unrealistic, adventures are supposed to be unrealistic in the first place.
                Upon waking up, the "player" would have a variety of choices to make, each one leading to another set of choices until finally, the adventure ends and the player can replay the adventure.
                However, whenever it made sense to do so, we made some of the choices lead to the same ending.
            </p>
            <h2> Reflection</h2>
            <p> Mr. Mueller probably assigned this project so that students would get used to working with others while coding. Prior to this project, we only ever had short assignments, or not using github in the first place, so having a project right after learning how to merge would allow students to see the benefits of using github versus other websites. We were also allowed to use .html instead of .md, which would allow students that were beginning to forget how to use HTML remember how to use it. This project allowed students to practice merging and collaborating with others. In me and Gabriel's scenario, however, it would allow us to expierence what it would be like if we were to work on a project with others in the future. Of course, our group was probably the only one that was able to do this, as Gabriel wasn't at school the entire time.</p>
            <p>
            A challenge that I had when working on this project was communicating with Gabriel, as we wouldn't be able to instantly respond to each other. I found out that this would force me to take the initiative to send messages to Gabriel, as if I stopped, there would be a chance that Gabriel simply couldn't work at all for a entire day. We overcame this issue by constantly sending messages to each other on slack. </p>
            <p>
                If we had more time to work on this project, I would add images to all of the files we made.
