            <h1 class="margin text-center">Turtle Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> The prompt for this project was to create a movie webpage about anything that doesn't currently exist. The title that
            I settled on was Sea Turtle Man.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p> Originally, the movie was supposed to be about a turtle protecting a coral reef from a shark, however as I ran out of time
            and had to use a single day to finish the text for both the movie and the sequel, the battle never actually took place
            until the sequel, and even then it was only a single sentence. This made the movie seem more like a short story, 
            as it was mainly just listing out the actions of the shark, such as approaching the reef, swimming past it, 
            coming back to the reef, etc.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> The hardest part of creating the movie was having an unreliable partner. It's really difficult to make a plan with someone 
                who would barely finish half of their responsibilities. A takeaway that I learned from this movie webpage
                is that if you want to finish projects that involve working with a partner, you either have to have a good partner that
                could finish all their responsibilities, or you have to do 80% of the work.</p>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p> If I had more time to work on this project, I would add more text to it, as from what it currently looks like, it's
            completely unfinished. </p>
